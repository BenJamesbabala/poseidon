# CNN: Caffe on Petuum

Caffe is a deep learning framework originally developed by Yangqing Jia / BVLC
(http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) where single GPU on single machine was used
to speedup the model training. Here we provide a **distributed (GPU/CPU)
version** of Caffe based on Petuum.  Most of the Caffe interfaces are kept
unchanged.

Please consult the [wiki
page](https://github.com/petuum/bosen/wiki/CNN:-Caffe-on-Petuum) for more
details.
